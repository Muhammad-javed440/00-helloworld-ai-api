    "What is AI?\n",
    "Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems are designed to learn, reason, and interact with their environment, and they can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance.\n",

    "Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is trained on large amounts of text data to generate human-like language. LLMs are designed to learn patterns and relationships in language, and they can be used for a variety of tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n",
